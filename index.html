        <h1>Ash Ketchum Welcomes You</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Ash Ketchum and I come from the town of Pallet.  I started my journey late because I slept in and<br>
            didn't get the standard starter pokémon of Squirtle, Bulbasaur or Charmander.  Instead, I got lucky and started with <br>
            Pikachu, who is now the best friend I have ever had.  Pikachu has been my pokemon partner for a long time now. We<br>
            didn't start as best friends but after doing an unconventional trust exercise with a bunch of Spearows, we have been<br>
            inseparable ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am what is known as a Pokémon Trainer.  Though this is the title that is for those who train and battle pokémon,<br>
            I aspire to continue my journey to be a Pokémon Master.  A Pokémon Master is one that is not just a trainer to pokémon<br>
            but also good friends, someone who can work alongside pokémon without having to be in control, but rather working in<br>
            collaboration with each other to achieve things we would not be able to without each other.<br>
        </p>
